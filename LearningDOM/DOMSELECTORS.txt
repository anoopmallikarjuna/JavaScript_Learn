document.getElementByID : fetches an element by its ID

can add .id || .className to get the the id or className of that particular element.

can join .getAttribute(attribute name) to fetch the attribute value of that particular attribute

can join .setAttribute(attribute name, new attribute name) to set the attribute name to a new one

can store the the result of getElementByID in a variable 

can use that variable to style that particular element i.e. variable.style.backgroundColor = 'green'

innerContent returns the entire value which includes the manipulated text using css
innerHTML returns the entire html of that particular element

QUERY SELECTORS:

1. document.querySelector(tagName) returns the fist element matching the tagName

If we want to use query selectors for a element using its id then we have to use # notation and 
if we want to use query selectors for a element using its class then we have to use . notation

2. document.querySelectorAll(tagName) returns a NodeList of all the elements matching with that tagName

We can only use forEach for nodelist for iterating purpose and if we want to use other array functions
then we have to convert the nodeList into a array using Array.from(nodeList name)

If we want to change the individual elements then we can do it by using nodeList[index number] and perform tasks

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.getElementsByClassName returns an HTMLCollection which cannot be use to iterate over the structure so we have to convert into an array in the above shown manner 
 and then we have to do the required operations...
